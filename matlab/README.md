# Matlab

## Toolbox

For the installation on the current R2018b version, you can run the installer 
and add `Parallel Server` just like you would for any other additional Toolbox.

## License

### File

For any new versions of MATLAB, just make sure that you are using the License 
 number or File Installation Key for `Parallel Server` specifically.

### Server

As for the License Server, you will just need to concatenate the `Parallel 
Server` License File with the current MATLAB License File.
Since they are different license numbers you will have to download them each separately.
