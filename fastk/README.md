FastK is a general purpose k-mer counter that is particularly fast on high-fidelity shotgun data sets. It can produce a histogram of k-mer counts, a k-mer table of k-mers and their counts, and sequence profiles that give the count of each k-mer along a sequence. There are simply utilities for manipulating the outputs and a C-library for doing so directly in C-code. Note particular that Logex is a very powerful utility for merging and logically combining k-mer tables.
