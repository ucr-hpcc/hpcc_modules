The original Merqury is a collection of R, Java, and shell scripts for producing k-mer analysis plots of genomic sequence data and assemblies with meryl as its core k-mer counter infra-structure. MerquryFK replaces meryl with the FastK k-mer counter suite to considerably speed up analyses. Moreover, all the R, Java, and shell scripts have been refactored into a typical collection of UNIX command line tools that the user will hopefully experience as easier to comprehend and invoke. In addition, we have realized some analyses, KatComp and KatGC, that one finds only in the somewhat similar KAT k-mer suite developed at the Earlham Institute. Lastly, we include in this collection, PloidyPlot which is an improved version of the ploidy plotting tool SmudgePlot.
