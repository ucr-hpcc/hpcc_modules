FIGARO: An efficient and objective tool for optimizing microbiome rRNA gene trimming parameters. FIGARO will quickly analyze error rates in a directory of FASTQ files to determine optimal trimming parameters for high-resolution targeted microbiome sequencing pipelines, such as those utilizing DADA2 and Deblur. The mission of this application is identical to the ZymoBIOMICS mission: increasing the reproducibility and standardization of microbiome analysis.
